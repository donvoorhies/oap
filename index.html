<h2>About:</h2>
<h3>"Don's Optimization Anthology Plugin" (abbrev.: OAP)</h3>
<p>An <i>"anthology"</i> of (IMO) some snazzy Wordpress-functions that I've across over time, which I use to optimize my Wordpress-installations.</p>

<p>The following functions this plugin quietly performs are (for now, as more functions might be added):</p>
<ul>
<li>Checks if Server-side compression is switched on</li>
<li>Links commonly-used jQuery-libs to a CDN</li>
<li>Removing versions + params on URI's</li>
<li>Sharpen resized image files</li>
<li>Deferring/async js-files</li>
<li>Embedding "Above The Fold" Critical Path CSS, defering CSS-files () and moving js from head to the footer</li>
<li>Minifying all HTML-used, by stripping line-breaks and unnecessary white-spaces</li>
</ul>
</article>

<h2>Installation:</h2>
<p>You can install this plugin via the WordPress admin panel.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/donvoorhies/oap/archive/main.zip" title="Download plugin-zip from here..." rel=”noreferrer”>Download</a> the latest zip of this repo  (the latest version is always the (only) one, which is available).</li>
<li>In your WordPress admin panel, navigate to Plugins->Add New</li>
<li>Click Upload Plugin</li>
<li>Upload the zip-file that you've just downloaded.</li>
<li>Activate from from the admin-panel</li>

</ol>

<h2>Configuration:</h2>
<p>The plugin will work right out of the box - <strong>almost</strong>...<br>
<p>For now, you're going to have get hold of the "Above The Fold" Critical Path CSS, and insert the generated string into the code in file, OAP_plugin.php.<br> 
You can find the "Above The Fold" Critical Path CSS-string by using Jonas Sebastian Ohlsson's generator at:</p>

<a href="https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/criticalpathcssgenerator/" title="Critical Path CSS Generator" rel=”noreferrer” target="_blank">https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/criticalpathcssgenerator/</a>

<p>Follow the instructions here, and copy and paste the generated string into the file (OAP_plugin.php; line 158 - or thereabouts) between the marked <code>"&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;"</code>-tags<br> 
(look for these, along with the identifiying comment:</p> 
<p><code>"/* INSERT GENERATED "ABOVE THE FOLD" CRITICAL PATH CSS-STRING HERE - EITHER UNDER THIS LINE OR BY REPLACING THIS LINE WITH THE GENERATED STRING...! */ ")</code>;</p>
<p>You can use your webhost's editor to perform this operation.</p>

<h3>Planned/"Wish-list":</h3>

<p>Future versions of this plugin might have implemented provisions to ease this process by inserting the generated "Above The Fold" Critical Path CSS-string via the admin-panel.</p>
