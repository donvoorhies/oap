# OAP
"Don's Optimization Anthology Plugin" (abbrev.: OAP)

An "anthology" of (IMO) some snazzy Wordpress-functions that I've across over time, which I use to optimize my Wordpress-installations.

The following funcions this plugin quietly performs are (for now, as more functions might be added):
- Checks if Server-side compression is switched on
- Links commonly-used jQuery-libs to a CDN
- Removing versions + params on URI's
- Sharpen resized image files
- Deferring/async js-files
- Embedding "Above The Fold" Critical Path CSS,  defering CSS-files () and moving js from head to the footer
- Minifying all HTML-used, by stripping line-breaks and unnecessary white-spaces 

Installation:

You can install this plugin via the WordPress admin panel.

1. Download the latest zip of this repo.
2. In your WordPress admin panel, navigate to Plugins->Add New
3. Click Upload Plugin
4. Upload the zip file that you downloaded.
5. Activate from from the admin-panel

Configuration:

This plugin will work right out of the box - almost...

For now, you're going to have get the "Above The Fold" Critical Path CSS, and insert the generated string into the code in file, OAP_plugin.php.
You can find the "Above The Fold" Critical Path CSS-string by using Jonas Sebastian Ohlsson's generator at: 

https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/criticalpathcssgenerator/

Follow the instructions here, and copy and paste the generated string into the file (OAP_plugin.php; line 158 - or thereabouts) between the marked "style"-tags (look for these, along with the identifiying comment:
"/* INSERT GENERATED "ABOVE THE FOLD" CRITICAL PATH CSS-STRING HERE - EITHER UNDER THIS LINE OR BY REPLACING THIS LINE WITH THE GENERATED STRING...! */
");
you can use your webhost's editor to perform this operation. 

Planned/"Wish-list":

Future versions of this plugin might have implemented provisions to ease this process by inserting the generated "Above The Fold" Critical Path CSS-string via the admin-panel.
